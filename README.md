<h1>vLLM Endpoint | Serverless Worker </h1>

[![CD | Docker-Build-Release](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-vllm/actions/workflows/docker-build-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-vllm/actions/workflows/docker-build-release.yml)

ðŸš€ | This serverless worker utilizes vLLM behind the scenes and is integrated into RunPod's serverless environment. It supports dynamic auto-scaling using the built-in RunPod autoscaling feature.
</div>

## Setting up the Serverless Worker

### Option 1:Deploy Any Model Using Pre-Built Docker Image
We now offer a pre-built Docker Image for the vLLM Worker that you can configure entirely with Environment Variables when creating the RunPod Serverless Endpoint:

<div align="center">

```runpod/worker-vllm:dev```

</div>

#### Environment Variables
- **Required**:
   - `MODEL_NAME`: Hugging Face Model Repository (e.g., `openchat/openchat_3.5`).

- **Optional**:
  - `MODEL_BASE_PATH`: Model storage directory (default: `/runpod-volume`).
  - `HF_TOKEN`: Hugging Face token for private and gated models (e.g., Llama, Falcon).
  - `NUM_GPU_SHARD`: Number of GPUs to split the model across (default: `1`).
  - `QUANTIZATION`: AWQ (`awq`) or SqueezeLLM (`squeezellm`) quantization.
  - `MAX_CONCURRENCY`: Max concurrent requests (default: `100`).
  - `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`: Token streaming batch size (default: `10`). This reduces the number of HTTP calls, increasing speed 8-10x vs non-batching, matching non-streaming performance.
  - `DISABLE_LOG_STATS`: Enable (`False`) or disable (`True`) vLLM stats logging.

### Option 2: Build Docker Image with Model Inside
To build an image with the model baked in, you must specify the following docker arguments when building the image:

- **Required**
  - `MODEL_NAME`
- **Optional**
  - `MODEL_BASE_PATH`: Defaults to `/runpod-volume` for network storage. Use `/models` or for local container storage.
  - `QUANTIZATION`
  - `HF_TOKEN`
  - `WORKER_CUDA_VERSION`: `11.8` or `12.1` (default: `11.8` due to a small amount of workers not having CUDA 12.1 support yet. `12.1` is recommended for optimal performance).

#### Example: Building an image with OpenChat-3.5
`sudo docker build -t username/image:tag --build-arg MODEL_NAME="openchat/openchat_3.5" --build-arg MODEL_BASE_PATH="/models" .`

### Compatible Models

Ensure that you have Docker installed and properly set up before running the docker build commands. Once built, you can deploy this serverless worker in your desired environment with confidence that it will automatically scale based on demand.
